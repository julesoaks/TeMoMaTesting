Mike is a hydrologic and atmospheric scientist that is a strong proponent of scientific work being fully reproducible, easily testable, open-source, and extendable. He also designs and builds systems for managing large amounts of data, develops the scientific processing and analysis tools that sit on top of these systems to do the data science magic, and creates the reporting tools to present the results in the most valuable way for users. He's had a varied career in the areas of clean(ish) freshwater science.
