Alice's focus is on investigating how organisms and ecosystems are affected by the ocean’s dynamic environment. She is particularly interested on physical/biological interactions at spatio-temporal scales ranging from few to hundreds of kilometers and a few hours to months. She's excited to learn how our understanding of these interactions can help us design conservation and management policies that fit the dynamic nature of coastal and open ocean regions.
