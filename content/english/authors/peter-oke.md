Peter is a Senior Principal Research Scientist at CSIRO, Australia, specialising in ocean data assimilation, ocean forecasting, ocean observing, and ocean dynamics.

He leads the Australian Argo Program and was a long-term contributor to the Bluelink Ocean Forecasting Australia Partnership. Peter developed the data assimilation system that underpinned Australia's first operational ocean forecast system and Australia's first eddy-resolving global ocean reanalysis.
 
Peter's particularly interested in better understanding the physical oceanography of the waters around Australia, and developing tools and products to support marine industries. Peter's current research focus includes development of data-driven ocean forecasting capabilities on National and Global scales for National, civilian benefit.
