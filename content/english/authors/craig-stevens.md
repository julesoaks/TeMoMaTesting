Craig Stevens is an oceanographer focused on the ocean’s extrema and how to measure them - the
coldest/warmest, the southern-most, the fastest, the harshest waves.

He grew up in Kaurna country in South Australia and studied in Australia and Canada before moving
to New Zealand in the 1990s. The science has enabled him to participate in 16 expeditions to Antarctica
and over 50 ocean experiments.  Through this time there has been a growing awareness of the importance of
telling the intertwined stories of Earth’s ocean and what the science is revealing about our future as we
enter the Anthropocene.

He is a Professor in Physics at the University of Auckland and a Principal Scientist with Earth
Sciences New Zealand. He has served as the President of the New Zealand Association of Scientists
and the Chair of the Aotearoa Wave and Tidal Energy Association.
