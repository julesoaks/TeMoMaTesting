Julian Drake is a recent oceanography graduate from the University of Auckland with a Master of
Geography. His thesis, a broad study of sea surface temperature variability in the Southwest Pacific,
is closely related to the topics explored in Te Moana Mahana and was supervised by Principal
Investigator Melissa Bowen.

Julian grew up in Huia, on the coast of the Manukau Harbour, and developed a keen curiosity in
understanding the natural world from a young age. With a growing awareness of the importance of
climate change during his youth, he developed a strong passion for climatology, with oceanography
becoming his primary subdivision by the time he completed his undergraduate studies.

As a young scientist in this project, he hopes to gain a significant understanding of how climate
science is conducted and large-scale research projects operate in practice.
