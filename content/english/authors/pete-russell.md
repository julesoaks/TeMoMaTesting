Tēnā koutou, Ko Pete Russell taku ingoa, no Ngāpuhi ahau.

I am an oceanographer who is interested in physical processes that support marine life. Recent work includes observing the biological response of the ocean in the wake of Tropical Cyclones. My work on Te Moana Mahana will look at how tropical cyclones contribute to marine primary production in the South Pacific region.
