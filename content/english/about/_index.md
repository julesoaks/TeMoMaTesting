      This research initiative aims to understand and predict the rapid warming of AoNZs regional oceans, which are currently heating at twice the global average. By integrating satellite data, robotic floats, and shipboard surveys with the innovative BlueMaps data assimilation technique, the project seeks to map the complex heat exchange between the deep and coastal oceans.

      Key processes include:

      - **Data Integration:** Combining existing deep-ocean observations with new data from fishing vessels (Mangōpare programme) and ocean glider transects.

      - **Mechanistic Analysis:** Investigating how ocean currents, wind patterns, and bathymetry (like canyons and banks) influence heat storage and transport.

      - **Predictive Modeling:** Developing a high-efficiency coastal and regional ocean reanalysis to identify "thermal refugia" and "hot spots," ultimately providing the first reliable predictability for sea surface temperatures in the region.

      This research focuses on bridging the gap between global climate trends and their specific impacts on AoNZ by refining coarse global data into high-resolution regional forecasts. By downscaling CMIP7 global simulations, the project will account for the unique influence of AoNZ’s rugged topography and complex seafloor (bathymetry) on weather and ocean behavior.

      Key processes include:

      - **High-Resolution Downscaling:** Transforming global projections into localized models to resolve narrow ocean currents and regional temperature extremes that global models miss.

      - **Machine Learning Forecasters:** Using "past analogues"—searching historical data for patterns similar to current conditions—to predict sea surface temperatures (SST) and quantify uncertainty.

      - **Coupled Weather Modeling:** Simulating the interaction between the atmosphere and a warming ocean at scales under 100km to understand how ocean heat strengthens "atmospheric rivers," tropical cyclones, and extreme rainfall.

      - **Sensitivity Assessment:** Testing how evolving coastal temperatures during a storm can modify the severity and path of weather events as they make landfall.
  - title: "Ocean Impacts"

      This initiative examines how shifts in ocean physics—such as warming and stratification—alter the biological health of AoNZ’s waters. By focusing on the Hauraki Gulf and Otago Shelf, the research explores how extreme weather like tropical cyclones and marine heatwaves impacts essential life-support systems: oxygen levels and nutrient availability.

      Key processes include:

      - **Nutrient Cycling via Cyclones:** Investigating how strengthening tropical cyclones pull nutrient-rich deep water to the surface, triggering phytoplankton blooms in otherwise "nutrient-poor" (oligotrophic) waters.

      - **Deoxygenation Pathways:** Tracking how warming subsurface waters hold less dissolved oxygen, creating "low oxygen zones" that threaten the survival of fish and marine bacteria.

      - **Ocean Stratification:** Analyzing how marine heatwaves create "layers" in the ocean that prevent the mixing of oxygen and nutrients, essentially isolating different parts of the water column.

      - **Coastal Run-off Dynamics:** Using simulations to assess how extreme rainfall events flush suspended sediment and land-based nutrients into the coastal ocean, altering salinity and water clarity.

  - title: "Ocean Connections"

      This initiative focuses on the human dimension of climate change, emphasizing that scientific data must be integrated with societal values to be effective. By connecting ocean-atmosphere research with the lived experiences of coastal communities, iwi, and hapū, the project aims to create adaptive resource management strategies that protect both economic and non-economic interests.

      Key processes include:

      - **Value-Based Decision Making:** Quantifying "non-economic loss and damage" by incorporating social, cultural, and environmental values into climate planning.

      - **Community Engagement:** Capturing the lived experiences of those in coastal areas to ensure interventions are locally relevant and responsive.

      - **Cross-Sector Integration:** Embedding findings into the workflows of national organizations to improve forecasting for agriculture, aquaculture, and emergency management.

      - **Localized Adaptation:** Developing resource management tools that empower local authorities, iwi, and hapū to respond to specific regional risks.

The ocean around Aotearoa New Zealand (AoNZ) is warming at twice the global rate,
fuelling weather systems and changing the ocean near the coast. New Zealand
is unprepared for the changes a warming ocean brings to extreme weather and
the coastal ocean.

This project is creating next generation tools needed for climate-related
decisions by providing novel observations, projections, and forecasting
of ocean temperatures and assessing the modification of extreme weather through
the following deliverables:
